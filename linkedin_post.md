🚀 **Exciting News: LinkedIn MCP Server for AI Integration**

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a LinkedIn Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges AI assistants with LinkedIn's API! 

**What it enables:**
✅ Seamless OAuth authentication
✅ Profile data retrieval  
✅ Automated post creation
✅ Content guideline compliance
✅ Compatible with Claude Code & Claude Desktop

**Perfect for:**
🔹 Developers building AI-powered LinkedIn tools
🔹 Content creators automating workflows
🔹 Teams integrating LinkedIn into AI assistants

The server follows LinkedIn's professional standards with built-in rate limiting (1 post/minute, 100/day) and content validation (3000 char limit, 10 mentions max).

Built with Python, FastMCP, and SQLAlchemy - it's production-ready with comprehensive error handling and token management.

**Getting started is simple:**
1️⃣ Clone the repo
2️⃣ Configure your LinkedIn OAuth app
3️⃣ Add to Claude Code/Desktop
4️⃣ Start creating!

What's your experience with AI automation for social platforms? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
