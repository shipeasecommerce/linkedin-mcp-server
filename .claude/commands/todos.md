# Todos Command

This command helps manage and track todo items throughout development sessions using a TODO.md file at the project root.

## Usage

Use this command to:
- Create structured todo lists for complex tasks
- Track progress on multi-step implementations
- Organize development priorities
- Maintain visibility into current work status

## File Management

- Todos are tracked in `TODO.md` at the project root
- The TODO.md file is gitignored to keep personal task lists out of version control
- Tasks persist across development sessions
- Can be shared or kept private as needed

## Examples

- Breaking down feature implementations
- Tracking bug fixes across multiple files
- Managing refactoring tasks
- Organizing testing requirements

## Todo States

- **pending**: Task not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
- **completed**: Task finished successfully

## Best Practices

- Keep only one task in_progress at a time
- Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Use clear, descriptive task names
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant
- Review and clean up TODO.md regularly
